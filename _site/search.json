    "text": "He’s not wrong… Photo by Andy Mason.\n\n\nI studied biology and obtained MSc in molecular biology from the University of Warsaw, Poland. Following my interest in science education and communication, after the university I co–founded and directed Science Festival School at the International Institute for Molecular and Cell Biology in Warsaw. It was one of the first full–time bioscience popularisation organisations in Poland and it is still active today as the Centre for Innovative Bioscience Education.\nHaving decided to learn more and do research in evolutionary genetics, I started my PhD at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, where I worked on metabolic and behavioural consequences of expression of putatively adaptive human genes in transgenic mice, under supervision of the 2022 Nobel Prize winner Svante Pääbo. I generated mice transgenic for genes thought to be important in human evolution, like GLUD2, a hominoid-specific gene encoding neurotransmitter-degrading enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase or a group of genes including ASPM and CENPJ that play a role in brain development and whose mutations cause microcephaly in humans. During my PhD I become more interested in functional and mechanistic basis of adaptive change, and followed this direction during a postdoc at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Plön, Germany, where I worked on identification of putatively adaptive genes in wild, non-model organism using whole–genome approaches. I studied copy-number variants in natural populations of Mus musculus domestics using custom made microarrays and microsatellite scans to identify CNVs under putative selective sweeps.\nI then switched my focus back to teaching and became involved in secondary and undergraduate education in the National Centre for Biotechnology Education at the University of Reading, UK, where I undertook a EU–funded project to develop practical teaching resources in synthetic biology for undergraduates. I worked on development of DNA parts, plasmids and protocols to manipulate them, as well as organised workshops for undergraduates and A-level students in synthetic biology. I helped establish and mentored the first Reading team for the International Genetically Engineered Machines competition, where the student–driven project—construction and characterisation of solar–powered, cyanobacteria-based fuel cell was awarded a bronze medal. During a subsequent Wellcome Trust’s Society Award to NCBE, I initiated development of similar experimental synthetic biology resources for A–level students before joining University of Huddersfield.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

And now, with some time as a PI under my belt and having some experience with both graduate and final-year undergraduate students, I can set up my own list (the one below is mostly based on Melissa’s, but was also influenced by J. Cameron Thrash’s list).\n\nMy responsibilities to graduate students:\n\nHelp develop project ideas.\nMeet at least bi-weekly to discuss project’s progress, pitfalls and plans.\nSupport travel to at least one meeting or workshop per year.\nAssist with data interpretation.\nProof-read and contribute to writing of manuscripts, fellowships and grants.\nProvide training and mentorship in soft skills, including teaching.\nDiscuss future career goals and career development, including careers outside academia.\nAssure appropriate working conditions and resources throughout the project.\n\n\n\nMy expectations of graduate students:\n\nPrepare for and participate in regular lab meetings.\nMaintain a set of lab notes, from both wet–lab and in silico work. These need to be sufficient to reproduce results without additional instructions.\nContribute to writing grant proposals.\nWrite and submit manuscripts.\nProof–read manuscripts from other lab members or colleagues from other groups.\nAttend departmental seminars.\nPresent a poster or talk of research progress at a conference at least once a year.\nParticipate in general lab responsibilities (servers, maintenance of common areas, taking turns hosting visitors etc.).\nBe available in the lab/office for a minimum pre-arranged set of hours to facilitate interactions.\nMentor at least one undergraduate student.\nContribute to teaching in the department (if you are funded by the university, this is an obligatory requirement).\n\n\n\n\nMy responsibilities to undergraduate students:\n\nPrepare a well–defined, challenging but achievable project.\nMeet weekly to discuss project’s progress, pitfalls and plans.\nAssist with data interpretation.\nProvide timely and constructive feedback on dissertation drafts, presentations and job, fellowship or further education applications.\nProvide advice and reference letters on job, fellowship or further education applications.\nDiscuss future career goals and career development, including careers outside academia.\n\n\n\nMy expectations of undergraduate students:\n\nBe familiar with and meet the module benchmarks such as: duration of lab work, deadlines for submission of draft introduction to your project, COSHH forms, format and structure of the dissertation etc..\nPrepare for and participate in regular lab meetings.\nMaintain a set of lab notes, from both wet–lab and in silico work. These need to be sufficient to reproduce results without additional instructions.\nBe inquisitive and proactive about your project’s goals, tasks, protocols and results.

They occupy environments as different as Spain and Siberia, contribute to spread of human diseases like Lyme borreliosis and tick-borne encephalitis and are a rich target for evolutionary studies. However, they are very underdeveloped in terms of their genomic and genetic resources. Our long-term goal is to help establish Apodemus as a full–blown model organism and utilise its generalist ecology for studies of evolution in the wild.\n\n\n\nApodemus flavicolis; photograph © Karol Zub\n\n\nThe major project we are currently undertaking is on improving the European phylogeography of the two species, Apodemus flavicolis (yellow-necked mouse, also confusingly called wood mouse in Polish) and Apodemus sylvaticus (wood mouse). The goal is to collect and describe large(ish)-scale (n &gt; 350 samples) data on genetic diversity and connectivity of the species and help answer some of the mysteries of recolonisation of Europe by small mammals following the last glaciation. The project is helmed by Maria Luisa Martin Cerezo and utilises restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) to obtain whole-genome, high-density genotypes even without a reference genome. It has been possible thanks to a number of colleagues across Europe, from Scotland and Portugal through Serbia to Lithuania, who provided samples from across the range of both species.\nThe first publication from this project, a small-scale phylogeographic analysis of Polish populations of Apodemus, has been published in 2020: Population structure of Apodemus flavicollis and comparison to Apodemus sylvaticus in northern Poland based on RAD-seq.\n\n\n\nThe second project, run by Rohan Raval in collaboration with Drs Karol Zub and Jan Boratyński at the Mammal Research Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences (MRI PAS) in Białowieża, Poland, will characterise the patterns of metabolic rates in a single population of A. flavicolis continually sampled for multiple seasons. The project involves genotyping and pedigree analysis of a large, wild population of mice and lab-based measures of basal metabolic rates (BMR) and torpor. Our goal is to measure heritability of BMR in the wild throughout multiple seasons as well as in-depth characterisation of population structure and dynamics."

Our long-term goal is to help establish Apodemus as a full–blown model organism and utilise its generalist ecology for studies of evolution in the wild.\n\n\n\nApodemus flavicolis; photograph © Karol Zub\n\n\nThe major project we are currently undertaking is on improving the European phylogeography of the two species, Apodemus flavicolis (yellow-necked mouse, also confusingly called wood mouse in Polish) and Apodemus sylvaticus (wood mouse). The goal is to collect and describe large(ish)-scale (n &gt; 350 samples) data on genetic diversity and connectivity of the species and help answer some of the mysteries of recolonisation of Europe by small mammals following the last glaciation. The project is helmed by Maria Luisa Martin Cerezo and utilises restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) to obtain whole-genome, high-density genotypes even without a reference genome. It has been possible thanks to a number of colleagues across Europe, from Scotland and Portugal through Serbia to Lithuania, who provided samples from across the range of both species.\nThe first publication from this project, a small-scale phylogeographic analysis of Polish populations of Apodemus, has been published in 2020: Population structure of Apodemus flavicollis and comparison to Apodemus sylvaticus in northern Poland based on RAD-seq.\n\n\n\nThe second project, run by Rohan Raval in collaboration with Drs Karol Zub and Jan Boratyński at the Mammal Research Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences (MRI PAS) in Białowieża, Poland, will characterise the patterns of metabolic rates in a single population of A. flavicolis continually sampled for multiple seasons. The project involves genotyping and pedigree analysis of a large, wild population of mice and lab-based measures of basal metabolic rates (BMR) and torpor. Our goal is to measure heritability of BMR in the wild throughout multiple seasons as well as in-depth characterisation of population structure and dynamics."

We were keen to see whether sequences of some of the parasites and vectors that Apodemus carry, such as ticks, Borrelia or hantaviruses could be retrieved from these carryover sequences. After Marisa checked that, indeed, Borrelia and Ixodes could be sequenced in our Apodemus RAD-seq protocol, Haeyam took over and during her placement she established a proof-of-principle, Kraken-based screen for microbial and insect sequences in our samples. This original idea was subsequently worked on by Ray (Wayne-hon Lau, my once placement student) to turn it into a proper pipeline to use in our future experiments, RAD-seq or otherwise."

Mustela nivalis nivalis and Mustela nivalis vulgaris. They live in relative sympatry (M. n. vulgaris is a recent invader from the south) and are similarly-looking during most of the year. However, when the days start to get shorter, the coat of the M. n. nivalis changes to completely white, providing it with camouflage and increased survival on snow cover, whereas the coat of the M. n. vulgaris stays a similar shade of brown during the entire year.\n\n\n\nLeast weasels in the summer and winter; photograph © Karol Zub\n\n\nWe are collaborating with Dr Karol Zub at MRI PAS and Dr José Melo-Ferreira at the Research Centre in Biodiversity and Genetic Resources at the University of Porto on elucidating the molecular and evolutionary forced underlying the seasonal colour change.\nWe started from Sanger–sequencing a host of putative candidate genes affecting coat colour in order to exclude a possibility of stable coding-sequence polymorphism affecting coat colour change, however, we were unable to proceed much further due to lack of fresh samples of Mustela. Fortunately, our colleagues in Portugal were much more successful with their high-throughput sequencing of museum samples.\nThe paper has now been published in MBE (open access!): Museomics dissects the genetic basis for adaptive seasonal colouration in the least weasel.\n\n\nAnalysis of sequencing reads with chimeric adapters in a large-scale-multiplexing RNA-seq experiment\nIn the course of some of the research described above, we designed and tested sequencing adapters and library preparation methods that enabled us to characterise the types of polymerase mishaps that happen whenever multiple different templates are being amplified together. Marisa and Rohan have been working on analysing various types of chimeric reads that are generated during our large-scale experiments with a view to improve existing protocols to minimise the influence of such reads on genotyping.\nThe paper has now been published in Molecular Ecology Resources (open access!): Identification and quantification of chimeric sequencing reads in a highly multiplexed RAD-seq protocol.\n\n\nExperimental teaching resources in synthetic biology\n\nThis project is completed, but every now and then we attempt to design and test new parts for UNIGEMS. If we succeed, they will be deposited in Addgene.\nSynthetic biology has enjoyed an explosive growth and a dramatic rise in prominence in the last decade, but the branch of synthetic biology that focuses on standardisation of DNA parts and thorough characterisation of genetic circuits still appears to be somewhat less than what it should be (with the fantastic exception of the International Genetically Engineered Machines competition). There is still a lack of well–characterised and tested sets of parts that allow for introducing synthetic biology concepts and techniques to secondary schools.\n\n\n\nFragment of a plasmid diagram showing GFP with a T5/lac promoter © Jarek Bryk\n\n\nNational Centre for Biotechnology Education at the University of Reading have been working on a Wellcome Trust–funded project to develop experimental resources in synthetic biology for the A-level education, following our previous work on the UNIGEMS project.

We knew we would be able to do this once Marisa switched to the four-adapter protocol by Franchini et al., and she and a fellow PhD student at Huddersfield, Bernardo, went away with the analysis. Rohan’s project delivered another few hundreds of samples genotyped with the same adapters and protocol, and in two different PCR setups. We had all the pieces for a really high-powered study. So, what did we find?\nThe bad news is that chimeras are there and most of the protocols do not allow for their identification at all, particularly if you put several multiplexed groups of samples on a single lane (as you most likely do). The good news is that if you maintain good quality standards in your wet-lab and computational pipeline (high molecular weight DNA, high coverage filters etc.), impact of the chimeras is minimal. We also have found that you should probably not attempt barcode rescue beyond 2 mismatches, as above that level you may be mainly creating chimeric rather than recovering actual reads.\nEnjoy the paper and congratulations to all involved!\nIdentification and quantification of chimeric sequencing reads in a highly multiplexed RAD-seq protocol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0CitationBibTeX citation:@online{bryk2022,\n  author = {Bryk, Jarek},\n  title = {Chimeras Paper Is Published},\n  date = {2022-07-06},\n  url = {https://bryklab.net/posts/2022-07-06-chimeras-paper-is-published/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBryk, Jarek. 2022. “Chimeras Paper Is Published.” July 6,\n2022. https://bryklab.net/posts/2022-07-06-chimeras-paper-is-published/."

I wasn’t aware of the YWT before, but it turns out they own a big farm over at Berry Brow, which they maintain to showcase agricultural practice that respects and enable wildlife to flourish. It’s called Stirley Community Farm and it includes a community centre, where they recently launched “Cake and Nature” series of talks—hence my visit.\nThe talk will take place on 16th February at 7pm (map) and I will be talking on how we use DNA to study evolution. The full abstract of my talk is below:\nIn the last decade, biological sciences have undergone a revolution: due to breakthrough developments in sequencing technologies—the capability to read DNA—it is now possible to obtain complete genetic information on a population scale. Apart from more mainstream application of these advances, such as genealogy or identification of disease–causing mutations, one of the most exciting is our ability to study patterns of genetic variation in wild populations of almost any species. This ability, coupled with studies of the genetics material of long–extinct organisms, allows unprecedented insight into the evolutionary history of many species.\nI will provide an overview of how we study molecular basis of evolutionary change by looking at DNA of modern and extinct species through several examples, from metabolism of bacteria and wings of peppered moths through the beaks of Darwin’s finches to the fur of beach mice and others, including the most self-obsessed of the apes, humans.\nThese advances are being developed on the background of our ability to also synthesize DNA of a desired sequence and modify DNA in situ to an extraordinary degree. Overall, they have turned biology into a sophisticated, statistics–based and data–driven discipline not unlike high-energy physics, justifying the expectations that the XXI century will be the age of biology.\nSee you there!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0CitationBibTeX citation:@online{bryk2017,\n  author = {Bryk, Jarek},\n  title = {My Talk at {Yorkshire} {Wildlife} {Trust}},\n  date = {2017-02-04},\n  url = {https://bryklab.net/posts/2017-02-04-my-talk-at-yorkshire-wildlife-trust/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBryk, Jarek. 2017. “My Talk at Yorkshire Wildlife Trust.”\nFebruary 4, 2017. https://bryklab.net/posts/2017-02-04-my-talk-at-yorkshire-wildlife-trust/."

However, the genomic and genetic resources for their studies remain very limited.\nWe are a young and small research group that has recently embarked on establishing phylogenetic and phylogeographic relationships between Apodemus populations in Europe based on whole-genome genotypes. Thanks to collaboration with researchers in Poland, Germany and Belgium we are presently acquiring and analysing whole-genome high-density genotyping data (ddRAD-seq) from hundreds of individuals across Europe. Analysis of this data will inform future directions of our studies: phylogeography of sylvaticus and flavicolis, diversity and divergence of their populations, SNP-based genetic maps and whole-genome scans for signatures of positive selection.\nWe are looking for an independent candidate with keen interest in evolution and computational approaches to study genetic variation on a population scale. Familiarity with UNIX/Linux, command line or R is a plus, as is research experience, preferably on a master’s level, but strong B.Sc. graduates are also encouraged to apply. Majority of the project involves computational analyses of large datasets, but it has a small wet-lab component, such as preparation of DNA and/or RNA sequencing libraries.\nThe PhD student will be associated with the Evolutionary and Environmental Genomics Group at the Department of Biological Sciences and embedded with PhD students in the Leverhulme Doctoral Training Centre who work on human and cattle phylogeography, archaeoentomology, yeast transposable elements and evolution of choanoflagellates using genomic approaches. The studentship requires candidates to undertake small teaching duties during the PhD. For more information about us and our work, please go to bryklab.net/research/ and Jarek Bryk’s staff profile. Candidates are encouraged to contact the project’s supervisor, Dr Jarek Bryk, directly with informal questions and requests.\nTo apply, send an email outlining your motivation and experience to j.bryk@hud.ac.uk (CC’d to f.cross@hud.ac.uk), including a CV and the names of two referees.

(Later we developed it further, to make it work in secondary schools and six forms, the primary market for NCBE.) We quickly made some progress (see the bacterial transformation kit availabe in NCBE since 2014) and put the protocols for the manipulation of the parts online (the website is no longer available).\nThen I started my independent position at Huddersfield and soon afterwards Dean suddenly died; John retired shortly after than and by the time I got around to finishing these resources, it was 2017. It was thanks to two of my project and placement students at Huddersfield, Abbie Williams and Alex Siddall, who took the project up and developed the plasmids and parts to the point where they could be deposited in Addgene for all to use.\nJason Sanders, another student at Huddersfield, also prepared the graphical materials - plasmid maps - which we hope will be useful for educators to prepare their own assembly diagrams.

The materials were overhauled thanks to the work of excellent students: Alex Siddall in my group, Abbie Williams and Jason Sanders (the latter from the School of Arts and Design here at Huddersfield), who expanded the number of parts available and prepared a new set of printed and digital materials to go with them. The manuscript is now published: UNIGEMS: plasmids and parts to facilitate teaching on assembly, gene expression control and logic in E. coli - enjoy.\n\n\nNext Generation Biologists workshops\nThis is a BBSRC STARS-programme-funded project that I am involved in alongside Dr Mary J. O’Connell, formerly at the University of Leeds and currently at the University of Notingham) and Martin Callaghan from the University of Leeds. We run a series of workshops to introduce and train researchers in the skills and best practices in scientific computing and bioinformatics. You can read all about the project and the workshops on the website nextgenbiologists.org. This project ended in February 2020\n\n\nProgramming for Evolutionary Biology 2018 conference\nThe Programming for Evolutionary Biology (PEB) conference brings together scientists broadly interested in applying bioinformatic tools to answer evolutionary and ecological questions. Unlike other conferences featuring mostly talks and poster sessions, it aims to serve as a platform for discussing common programming pitfalls encountered during research and features workshops to further develop participants’ bioinformatic skills. This project was really nice :-)"

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nThese resources are aimed at undergraduates and are thought to facilitate training in synthetic biology at this level. We assume limited knowledge of participants about the techniques and approaches in synthetic biology, but we expect the staff presenting the resources and running the practical activities will be familiar with basic microbiological and molecular biology techniques. They will equip the participants with foundational skills, techniques and approaches with which they can build and/or modify other genetic circuits, and assess their performance.\nThe resources are all based on intellectual-property-rights-free parts. All plasmids and parts can be used freely, and their sequences (and plasmids themselves) have been deposited in established repositories (figshare.com and addgene.com) so that everyone could learn about them and use them.\nThese protocols and pre-selected parts allow a practical introduction to basic techniques and approaches used in synthetic biology, and also introduce good microbiological laboratory practice, a necessity for safe and responsible conduct in any synthetic biology project. They guide students in choosing their constructs and then modifying and measuring them. We believe this creates engagement and ownership that sets these practicals apart from conventional “follow the recipe for the predetermined outcome” tasks during practical work.\n\nKit 1: Bacterial transformation and basic microbiological techniques\n\nThe first practical “kit” is very much based on the simple transformation protocol kit NCBE has been selling for the last year and aims at introducing basic microbiological techniques and practical experience of one of the foundational techniques in synthetic biology, namely bacterial transformation. Students transform E. coli with a plasmid DNA that confers resistance to antibiotic kanamycin, as well as a gene encoding green fluorescent protein from the jellyfish Aquorea victoria.\n\n\nKit 2: PCR, Gibson and DNA assembly\n\nThe second practical kit introduces another foundational technique in synthetic biology - DNA assembly, as well as basic molecular biology techniques like polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Students use PCR to generate several DNA parts made on the template of plasmid DNA, and then assemble these parts in novel configurations to produce new plasmid molecules, which are then used to transform bacteria. The newly–assembled parts may also be sequenced to confirm correct assembly of the molecules. The plasmids the participants are able to create may encode:\n\ngreen fluorescent protein (that emits visible light upon UV/blue light induction)\nred fluorescent protein that is also visible in daylight without the need to excite it\na banana odour generator that makes bacteria smell like bananas upon adding isoamyl alcohol\na beta-galactosidase gene that encodes an enzyme that digests lactose.\n\nIt is worth emphasising that students themselves decide which of the plasmids they want to make and proceed to select appropriate PCR primers and calculate appropriate amounts of DNA parts for the assembly of their molecules of choice. A group of students may create up to four different plasmids encoding different functions or proteins. These plasmids become the basis of modifications and measurements in Kit 3.\nDNA assembly methods are currently a very dynamic research field, and new or modified methods appear regularly. We have decided to use Gibson Assembly, as it is a relatively straightforward method that only requires a single step, 60-minute-long reaction to combine several DNA parts in a desired order. While commercially-available reagents for Gibson Assembly are expensive, in-house preparation of the master mixture reduces the costs considerably. Importantly, Gibson Assembly allows essentially any plasmid molecule to be turned into a vector or a part for the assembly, by virtue of design and selection of PCR primers, a simple procedure that every molecular biology laboratory does regularly. We do note, however, that given an extremely rapid developments in the field of DNA sequencing and synthesis, it is quite likely that in several years all current assembly methods will become obsolete, as all and any DNA parts or whole plasmids will be ordered online and synthesised commercially at low cost.\n\n\nKit 3: Engineering expression\n\nFinally, the third practical kit expands on the DNA assembly concept: it provides a set of new, ready-made parts that allow the expression of genes on plasmids assembled using Kit 2 to be modified, using procedures learnt in Kit 2: PCR and Gibson Assembly. The concept of this kit is most similar to a definition of synthetic biology: ‘the construction of novel genetic systems and pathways from a set of pre-optimised, pre- characterised and compatible DNA sequences to design organisms with desirable characteristics’. The parts provided in the kit allow genes of interest to be ‘switched on’ constitutively, or a􏰂er adding a certain chemical. It also permits the modulation of the activity of the genes. The four genes on a plasmid in Kit 2 have been chosen so that each challenges students to quantify their activity using a different approach. While both GFP and RFP activity could be measured by fluorimeter or cytometer, RFP is also visible in daylight, enabling visual estimation of the RFP production by a given construct. The banana smell must be measured with a series of standard “banana flavours” of different strengths or by gas chromatography, and beta-galactosidase by a colorimetric enzymatic reaction.\n\n\nSequences, plasmids, videos, etc.\n\nPlasmid and promoter parts sequences\nThe plasmid sequences and maps used in the kits 1 and 2, p005kanRFP, p006kanGFP and p007ampGFP, as well as sequences of the promoter parts used in kit 3, are available for download from Figshare.com. They can be opened using SnapGene software (paid, but with 1 month free trial available) or with the free SnapGene viewer. Moreover, the plasmid molecules were deposited in an open repository Addgene.org.\n\n\n\nPractical synthetic biology workshop for undergraduates\n\nThe resources presented on this page were trialed during their development on a workshop for undergraduates at the University of Reading in June 2013. The report from this course is available for download, as it may serve as useful guide to what approach to use to introduce basic synthetic biology techniques and approaches to students."
